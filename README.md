# Clippr

Good, free and simple clipboard manager. (Hopefully)

What is wrong with modern clipboards?
- 1 item inventory is realy bad
- No history of copied items
- No preview of copied items

## History

This project is a part of the [old hackathon project](https://github.com/HammerSmashedFace/Clippr) from 2017. I was using it for some time, but it is really buggy and completely stop working somewhere on Mojave.
